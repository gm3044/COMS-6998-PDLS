# COMS-6998-PDLS

This course serves as a graduate-level practical introduction to Deep Learning, with an
emphasis on practical system performance issues and related research. The course will cover
several topics related to Deep Learning (DL) systems and their performance. Both algorithmic
and system related building blocks of DL systems will be covered including DL training
algorithms, network architectures, and best practices for performance optimization. We will
study hyperparameter choices, scalable distributed DL training, Kubernetes based DL system
stack on cloud, tools and benchmarks for performance evaluation of DL systems, transfer
learning, federated learning etc. Emphasis will be on getting working knowledge of tools and
techniques for performance evaluation of DL systems. The students will gain practical
experience working on different stages of DL life cycle, including model development, testing,
and deployment. The assignments will be mostly hands-on involving standard DL frameworks
(Tensorflow, Pytorch) and open source technologies.
